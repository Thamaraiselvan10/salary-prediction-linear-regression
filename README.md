# ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

A machine learning project that uses **Linear Regression** to predict employee salaries based on years of experience.  
Implemented in **Python** with **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Salary.xlsx # Dataset containing years of experience & salary
â”œâ”€â”€ linear_regression_model.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with full ML workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # Project documentation
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset (`Salary.xlsx`) contains two columns:

| YearsExperience | Salary  |
|-----------------|---------|
| 1.1             | 39343   |
| 1.3             | 46205   |
| 1.5             | 37731   |

- **YearsExperience** â†’ Independent variable (X)  
- **Salary** â†’ Dependent variable (y)  

---

## ðŸš€ Workflow
1. **Import Libraries** â†’ pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
2. **Load Dataset** â†’ Read Excel file into pandas DataFrame  
3. **Preprocessing** â†’ Extract features (X) and labels (y)  
4. **Split Dataset** â†’ Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)  
5. **Train Model** â†’ Fit Linear Regression model  
6. **Visualize Results** â†’ Regression line vs training/testing data  
7. **Prediction** â†’ Predict salary for any years of experience

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Prediction
After training, you can make predictions like this:

```python
years_of_experience = [[5]]
predicted_salary = my_model.predict(years_of_experience)
print(f"Predicted Salary for 5 years of experience: {float(predicted_salary[0]):.2f}")
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Value may differ slightly based on dataset splits.
Output:
```
Predicted Salary for 5 years of experience: 73245.67
```
